# virtual-influencer

A playground for the OpenAI API using the chat completions endpoint and DALL-E. The user can provide a small prompt and the script will create an instagram post for this prompt. Then, several image prompts are created for DALL-E, based on the generated post, and if satisfied, several images are generated based on these prompts that can be used along with the post.

Run `python src/main.py` to start the script.

Dependencies can be installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
